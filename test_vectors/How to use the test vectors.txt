Use the following scripts to verify the decoder implementation:

o test_decoder.sh
  run the test_decoder.sh(in Linux).
  This will run the decoder and compare the output audio file with the reference audio files. 
  The result is written to test_decoder_report.txt.
  For each file, the bitstreams are either BIT-EXACT or they match up to a certain
  AVERAGE WEIGHTED SNR.


NOTE: When using the shell script, make sure it is marked as executable.
      This can be done by: chmod +x *.sh
